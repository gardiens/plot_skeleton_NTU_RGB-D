The goal of this project is to propose some tools to see skeleton of the NTU_RGB+D dataset.
The authors of the dataset proposed some code in matlab but I don't want to use it so I proposed my own code in python. I searched on the web as well but I didn't see any working solution or well documented one.


## Installation
To use this repo you need two things:
1. Install the requirements
```py
   pip install requirements.txt
   ```
2. Download ffmpeg to save videos. It is really easy to download and works almost every time, you can find it [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)


## Usage: 
Follow the getting started to have a quick hands-on. Every function are documented  
I recommend to save the video to see them because the matplotlib.animation can be buggy on some jupyter ( or vscode). They are stored in the folder videos.
